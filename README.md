## Architecture

The Shogun Relay Server combines several key technologies:

### GunDB Integration

The relay serves as a Gun peer node, providing:
- WebSocket endpoint for real-time data synchronization
- RAD (Radisk) persistence for graph data
- Optional transaction logging for audit purposes
- Native Gun user authentication system
- User-specific API token management
- Bulletproof message handling with Bullet Catcher integration

### ShogunCore Integration

The relay integrates with ShogunCore for enhanced authentication:
- WebAuthn support for passwordless authentication
- MetaMask authentication for web3 integration
- Traditional username/password authentication
- Wallet management for crypto operations
- Unified relay verifier for on-chain membership validation

### Blockchain Integration

The relay includes these key blockchain components:
- **RelayVerifier**: Validates if users are authorized members of the Shogun protocol
- **RelayRegistry**: Manages relay registration and permissions
- **EntryPoint**: Contract handling relay execution and verification

#### On-Chain Membership Verification

When enabled, the relay can verify if GunDB message senders are authorized members of the protocol:

- When `ONCHAIN_MEMBERSHIP_ENABLED=true`, the relay server will:
  - Extract the public key from incoming Gun messages
  - Format the key appropriately for blockchain verification
  - Verify the public key against the RelayRegistry smart contract
  - Authorize or reject messages based on on-chain verification
  - Provide an additional layer of security by ensuring only authorized participants can interact with the system

This provides true decentralized access control, where membership is verified on-chain rather than just through tokens or credentials.

#### Ethereum Transaction Signing

For blockchain interactions that require write operations (transactions):

- Read operations (like checking membership) don't require a private key
- Write operations require a private key
- Configure `ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY` in your `.env` file to enable write operations
- The relay will automatically create a signer using this private key to sign transactions
- For security, consider using environment variables rather than hardcoding the key
- If no private key is provided, write operations will fail with appropriate error messages

### IPFS Layer

The IPFS integration provides:
- Automatic data retrieval from IPFS when referenced in GunDB
- Support for both local IPFS nodes and Pinata cloud storage
- Configurable fallback to local storage when IPFS is unavailable
- Optional encryption of IPFS content for enhanced privacy

### File Storage System

The file system offers:
- Multi-part file uploads with streaming support
- Automatic IPFS backup when enabled
- Local file storage fallback
- Metadata tracking in GunDB
- Configurable storage path and file size limits

## Key Pair Generator

The relay includes a built-in key pair generator page at `/keypair` that allows:
- Generation of cryptographic key pairs compatible with GunDB
- Downloading key pairs as JSON files
- Using key pairs for authentication with Gun.js or Shogun applications
- Certificate-based API token generation

## Security Enhancements

The server includes several security enhancements:

1. CORS protection with specific configurations for different API endpoints
2. Token-based authentication for APIs with user-specific tokens
3. WebSocket connection validation
4. Input sanitization for API parameters
5. Comprehensive error handling with Bullet Catcher integration
6. Gun's native SEA (Security, Encryption, Authorization) for user management
7. Certificate-based authentication for enhanced security
8. Debug mode for troubleshooting message validation issues

## Environment Variables

For security reasons, several configurations should be set via environment variables instead of hardcoding in the source code. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Server configuration
PORT=8765
HOST=localhost
NODE_ENV=development  # Use 'production' for production environments

```

## User Management System

The relay includes a complete user management system with the following features:

### Native GunDB User Authentication

The system uses Gun's native SEA (Security, Encryption, Authorization) module:
- Secure cryptographic key pairs for each user
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Digital signatures for authenticity verification
- Zero-knowledge proof authentication

### ShogunCore Authentication Methods

Multiple authentication methods are available through ShogunCore:
- Username and password authentication
- WebAuthn (passwordless) authentication using biometrics or security keys
- MetaMask authentication for web3/Ethereum integration
- Key pair-based authentication

### User Registration and Authentication

Users can register with a username, password, and optional email:
- User credentials are securely managed by Gun's SEA system
- Additional profile data is stored in the user's secure space
- Gun certificates (proof of identity) are provided to clients upon login

### Token Management

Each user can have multiple API tokens with:
- Customizable names for different purposes/applications
- Optional expiration dates
- Ability to revoke tokens
- Last used timestamps for tracking

### Permission System

The system includes a basic permission system:
- System/admin token with full access
- User-specific tokens with configurable permissions
- Permission checking in sensitive operations

### Client Integration

Clients can seamlessly integrate with both systems:
- Gun's user authentication for real-time data security
- API tokens for REST API access
- Gun certificates returned on login can be stored for continued session use

## Blockchain Integration APIs

The relay server provides several REST APIs for interacting with the blockchain components:

### Relay Membership Verifier API

These endpoints allow verification of protocol membership:

- `GET /api/relay/membership/status` - Check relay membership service status
- `GET /api/relay/membership/check-address/:address` - Check if an Ethereum address is authorized
- `POST /api/relay/membership/check-pubkey` - Check if a public key is authorized
- `POST /api/relay/membership/address-for-pubkey` - Get the address associated with a public key
- `GET /api/relay/membership/user-info/:address` - Get user information for an address
- `GET /api/relay/membership/is-active/:address` - Check if a user's subscription is active
- `POST /api/relay/membership/authorize-key` - Temporarily authorize a key for relay use
- `POST /api/relay/membership/config` - Update relay membership configuration (admin only)

## Debug Command

When typing "/debug" in a web application context, the system will:
1. Examine console logs
2. Take a screenshot of the page through the MPC server
3. Provide diagnostic information to help troubleshoot issues

This feature is particularly useful for developers testing the integration of Shogun with web applications.

## IPFS-GunDB Middleware

The relay includes a middleware that integrates GunDB with IPFS:

### How It Works

1. **Data Retrieval**: When GunDB data contains IPFS references (ipfsHash), the middleware automatically retrieves the full data from IPFS
2. **Format Support**: Handles both direct IPFS hash references and structured references
3. **Client-Side Storage**: Allows clients to store data on IPFS and reference it in GunDB

### Usage Examples

**Storing data in IPFS from client**:
```javascript
// Client-side code
const storeInIPFS = async (data) => {
  // Upload to IPFS first
  const ipfsHash = await ipfsClient.add(JSON.stringify(data));
  
  // Store only the reference in GunDB
  gun.get('myNode').put({
    ipfsHash: ipfsHash.path,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
};
```

**Retrieving data**:
```javascript
// Client-side code
gun.get('myNode').on((data) => {
  // The middleware automatically retrieves the full data from IPFS
  console.log(data); // Complete data, not just the reference
});
```

## Running the Server

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Create and configure your `.env` file with appropriate values

3. Start the server:
   ```
   node src/index.js
   ```

## API Authentication

All API endpoints are protected with token-based authentication. You need to provide the token in one of these ways:

1. In the Authorization header: `Authorization: your_token_here` or `Authorization: Bearer your_token_here`
2. As a query parameter: `?token=your_token_here`
3. In the request body: `{ "token": "your_token_here" }`
